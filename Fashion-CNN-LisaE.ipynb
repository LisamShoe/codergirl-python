    "### Convolutional Neural Networks in Python with Keras\n",
    "In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn how to implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in Python with Keras, and how to overcome overfitting with dropout.\n",
    "You might have already heard of image or facial recognition or self-driving cars. These are real-life implementations of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In this blog post, you will learn and understand how to implement these deep, feed-forward artificial neural networks in Keras and also learn how to overcome overfitting with the regularization technique called \"dropout\".\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, you'll tackle the following topics in today's tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will be introduced to convolutional neural networks;\n",
    "- Then, you'll first try to understand the data. You'll use Python and its libraries to load, explore and analyze your data,\n",
    "-  After that, you'll preprocess your data: you'll learn how to resize, rescale, convert your labels into one-hot encoding vectors and split up your data in training and validation sets;\n",
    "-  With all of this done, you can construct the neural network model: you'll learn how to model the data and form the network. Next, you'll compile, train and evaluate the model, visualizing the accuracy and loss plots;\n",
    "- Then, you will learn about the concept of overfitting and how you can overcome it by adding a dropout layer;\n",
    "- With this information, you can revisit your original model and re-train the model. You'll also re-evaluate your new model and compare the results of both the models;\n",
    "- Next, you'll make predictions on the test data, convert the probabilities into class labels and plot few test samples that your model correctly classified and incorrectly classified;\n",
    "- Finally, you will visualize the classification report which will give you more in-depth intuition about which class was (in)correctly classified by your model.\n",

    "### Convolutional Neural Network: Introduction\n",
    "By now, you might already know about machine learning and deep learning, a computer science branch that studies the design of algorithms that can learn. Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that is inspired by artificial neural networks, which in turn are inspired by biological neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "A specific kind of such a deep neural network is the convolutional network, which is commonly referred to as CNN or ConvNet. It's a deep, feed-forward artificial neural network. Remember that feed-forward neural networks are also called multi-layer perceptrons(MLPs), which are the quintessential deep learning models. The models are called \"feed-forward\" because information flows right through the model. There are no feedback connections in which outputs of the model are fed back into itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs specifically are inspired by the biological visual cortex. The cortex has small regions of cells that are sensitive to the specific areas of the visual field. This idea was expanded by a captivating experiment done by Hubel and Wiesel in 1962 (if you want to know more, here's a video). In this experiment, the researchers showed that some individual neurons in the brain activated or fired only in the presence of edges of a particular orientation like vertical or horizontal edges. For example, some neurons fired when exposed to vertical sides and some when shown a horizontal edge. Hubel and Wiesel found that all of these neurons were well ordered in a columnar fashion and that together they were able to produce visual perception. This idea of specialized components inside of a system having specific tasks is one that machines use as well and one that you can also find back in CNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks have been one of the most influential innovations in the field of computer vision. They have performed a lot better than traditional computer vision and have produced state-of-the-art results. These neural networks have proven to be successful in many different real-life case studies and applications, like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Image classification, object detection, segmentation, face recognition;\n",
    "- Self driving cars that leverage CNN based vision systems;\n",
    "- Classification of crystal structure using a convolutional neural network;\n",
    "- And many more, of course!\n",
    "To understand this success, you'll have to go back to 2012, the year in which Alex Krizhevsky used convolutional neural networks to win that year's ImageNet Competition, reducing the classification error from 26% to 15%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) began in the year 2010 is an annual competition where research teams assess their algorithms on the given data set and compete to achieve higher accuracy on several visual recognition tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was the time when neural networks regained prominence after quite some time. This is often called the \"third wave of neural networks\". The other two waves were in the 1940s until the 1960s and in the 1970s to 1980s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, you know that you'll be working with feed-forward networks that are inspired by the biological visual cortex, but what does that actually mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the picture:\n",
    "\n",
    "[Convolutional Neural Network](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Typical_cnn.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The image shows you that you feed an image as an input to the network, which goes through multiple convolutions, subsampling, a fully connected layer and finally outputs something.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what are all these concepts?\n",
    "\n",
    "The convolution layer computes the output of neurons that are connected to local regions or receptive fields in the input, each computing a dot product between their weights and a small receptive field to which they are connected to in the input volume. Each computation leads to extraction of a feature map from the input image. In other words, imagine you have an image represented as a 5x5 matrix of values, and you take a 3x3 matrix and slide that 3x3 window or kernel around the image. At each position of that matrix, you multiply the values of your 3x3 window by the values in the image that are currently being covered by the window. As a result, you'll get a single number that represents all the values in that window of the images. You use this layer to filtering: as the window moves over the image, you check for patterns in that section of the image. This works because of filters, which are multiplied by the values outputted by the convolution.\n",
    "The objective of subsampling is to get an input representation by reducing its dimensions, which helps in reducing overfitting. One of the techniques of subsampling is max pooling. With this technique, you select the highest pixel value from a region depending on its size. In other words, max pooling takes the largest value from the window of the image currently covered by the kernel. For example, you can have a max-pooling layer of size 2 x 2 will select the maximum pixel intensity value from 2 x 2 region. You're right to think that the pooling layer then works a lot like the convolution layer! You also take a kernel or a window and move it over the image; The only difference is the function that is applied to the kernel and the image window isn't linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[Max Pooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network#/media/File:Max_pooling.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the fully connected layer is to flatten the high-level features that are learned by convolutional layers and combining all the features. It passes the flattened output to the output layer where you use a softmax classifier or a sigmoid to predict the input class label.\n",

    "### The Fashion-MNIST Data Set\n",
    "Before you go ahead and load in the data, it's good to take a look at what you'll exactly be working with! The Fashion-MNIST dataset is a dataset of Zalando's article images, with 28x28 grayscale images of 70,000 fashion products from 10 categories, and 7,000 images per category. The training set has 60,000 images, and the test set has 10,000 images. You can double check this later when you have loaded in your data! ;)\n",
    "\n",
    "Fashion-MNIST is similar to the MNIST dataset that you might already know, which you use to classify handwritten digits. That means that the image dimensions, training and test splits are similar to the MNIST dataset. Tip: if you want to learn how to implement an Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for classification tasks with this latter dataset, go to this tutorial.\n",

The reason why you convert the categorical data in one hot encoding is that machine learning algorithms cannot work with categorical data directly. You generate one boolean column for each category or class. Only one of these columns could take on the value 1 for each sample. Hence, the term one-hot encoding.\n",

The important thing to note here is that the vector consists of all zeros except for the class that it represents, and for that, it is 1. For example, the ankle boot image that you plotted above has a label of 9, so for all the ankle boot images, the one hot encoding vector would be [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0].\n",

For the model to generalize well, you split the training data into two parts, one designed for training and another one for validation. In this case, you will train the model on 80\\% of the training data and validate it on 20\\% of the remaining training data. This will also help to reduce overfitting since you will be validating the model on the data it would not have seen in training phase, which will help in boosting the test performance."

    "In Keras, you can just stack up layers by adding the desired layer one by one. That's exactly what you'll do here: you'll first add a first convolutional layer with Conv2D(). Note that you use this function because you're working with images! Next, you add the Leaky ReLU activation function which helps the network learn non-linear decision boundaries. Since you have ten different classes, you'll need a non-linear decision boundary that could separate these ten classes which are not linearly separable.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, you add Leaky ReLUs because they attempt to fix the problem of dying Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs). The ReLU activation function is used a lot in neural network architectures and more specifically in convolutional networks, where it has proven to be more effective than the widely used logistic sigmoid function. As of 2017, this activation function is the most popular one for deep neural networks. The ReLU function allows the activation to be thresholded at zero. However, during the training, ReLU units can \"die\". This can happen when a large gradient flows through a ReLU neuron: it can cause the weights to update in such a way that the neuron will never activate on any data point again. If this happens, then the gradient flowing through the unit will forever be zero from that point on. Leaky ReLUs attempt to solve this: the function will not be zero but will instead have a small negative slope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you'll add the max-pooling layer with MaxPooling2D() and so on. The last layer is a Dense layer that has a softmax activation function with 10 units, which is needed for this multi-class classification problem.\n",
